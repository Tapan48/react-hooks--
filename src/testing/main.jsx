// React Testing Library:
// This is a popular testing library specifically designed for testing React components. 
// It's part of the larger Testing Library family and provides a set of utilities that encourage better testing practices. 
// The key philosophy of React Testing Library is to test your components in a way that resembles how users would interact with your application.

// Features:

// Encourages testing behavior over implementation
// Provides utility functions to query DOM elements
// Simulates user interactions like clicking, typing, etc.
// Focuses on accessibility and how users perceive the application




// Unit Testing:
// Unit testing involves testing individual units of code in isolation. In React, a "unit" could be a single component, a function, or a module. The goal is to verify that each unit of the software performs as designed.
// Benefits:

// Helps catch bugs early in the development process
// Improves code quality and maintainability
// Acts as documentation for how code should behave
// Facilitates refactoring with confidence
